# Insights and Recommendations 


To analyze customer churn rate, we can ask the structured questions using 5W1H methods for instance: 

#### - What companies are our customers leaving for? (Competitive Analysis)

#### - Why do customers leave us? (Customer Surveys, In-depth Interviews, Market Analysis)

#### - When do customers decide to leave? (Mapping out the Customer Journey)

#### - Where do we see the highest churn? (Regional Surveys and Market Analysis)

#### - How can we win them back or increase customer retention? Should we focus on general strategies, choose and prioritize specific groups, or redefine our target audience?

### Mapping out Customer Journey

Mapping the customer journey helps the company identify the stages where churn is highest and where more touchpoints are needed.

Typically, a customer journey map includes: Awareness, Consideration, Purchase, Retention, and Advocacy.

However, this map will vary by industry and company. It is recommended to create a tailored journey map for our organization, identifying pain points and opportunities for engagement.

### Customer Survey and In-depth Cusotmer Interview 

Conducting customer surveys and in-depth interviews provides valuable insights into customer experiences and satisfaction levels.

- Segmented satisfaction surveys by gender, age group, tenure, and region.
- In-depth customer interviews to better understand individual experiences

### Competitive and Customer Analysis 

What products or banks are our customers choosing instead of us, and why?

Customer preferences evolve over time, such as changing needs, benefits, or spending habits.

For instance, Year 9 customers may have been attracted to our benefits in the past, but as they age, benefits targeting seniors from another bank might motivate them to leave.

It’s essential to conduct competitive and customer analyses regularly—at least twice a year—to keep up with shifting business landscapes.

### Market analysis in France and Germany 

Germany shows a significantly higher churn rate and number of churned customers. Potential causes might include:

Intense competition.
Poor customer service.
Weak localization strategies.
Economic factors specific to the country.
A focused market analysis in Germany and France can help uncover the underlying issues and drive informed action plans.
